# Doc Builder

In July 2018 I applied to work with Proposify.com. They are a SaaS company that writes online proposal managment and design software. Think Photoshop for proposals, cloud based, collect payments, track sales and much more. It was a full stack LAMP position.

I wanted to write a little project over the weekend to work on my JavaScript (I was more comfortable with PHP at the time) and to show my comitment.

This is that project, written over two days 100% from scratch. It works mostly and I learn a lot. I was hoping to get further but in the end I got the job and that was purpose of this project.
